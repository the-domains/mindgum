Welcome to mindgum.

This is a place to talk about everything on your mind that sticks.

That sounds cool. But what does that even mean?

It's a place where we'll talk about depression and anxiety.

On mindgum, I'll share my thoughts and experiences with depression, anxiety and the like.

From lighthearted jokes to the really dark and heavy stuff. I mean, really heavy.

Join me if you want to read personal stories about these mental issues from a real person or if you are experiencing these yourself.

My goal is to create a community of understanding, recognition, growth and support.

For now, you can head over to [Pinterest][0] to follow mindgum and like the page on [Facebook][1] to be notified when the first story goes live.
